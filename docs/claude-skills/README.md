# Claude Code Skills & Agents — STF + Lisa

Reference copies of the Claude Code agents, slash commands, and skills that power the
**Synthetic Test Fabric** (`stf`) and **Lisa AI QA Engineer** (`lisa`) workflows. These
files live here as documentation; they are not loaded by Claude Code automatically
from this location — see Installation below.

## Where Claude Code looks for these files

Claude Code loads agents, commands, and skills from two locations:

| Scope | Path | Loaded when |
|-------|------|-------------|
| User (global) | `~/.claude/agents/`, `~/.claude/commands/`, `~/.claude/skills/` | Any project |
| Project (local) | `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/commands/`, `.claude/skills/` | This project only |

**Agent files** must have YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `model`, `tools`).
**Skill files** must be named exactly `SKILL.md` and have YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `allowed-tools`).
**Command files** are any `.md` file in the `commands/` directory; `/filename` is the command.

---

## Installation options

### Option A — Copy to user-level `~/.claude/` (recommended, available everywhere)

The published npm package only ships the STF-specific files (`skills/stf/SKILL.md` +
`agents/stf-runner.md`). The Lisa skills/agents/commands live in this repo as
reference documentation only — to install them you need a checked-out copy.

```bash
# Run from a checked-out copy of synthetic-test-fabric.
DEST=~/.claude

# STF (ships in the npm package — also available via `node_modules/synthetic-test-fabric/docs/claude-skills/`)
mkdir -p $DEST/agents $DEST/skills/stf
cp docs/claude-skills/agents/stf-runner.md $DEST/agents/
cp docs/claude-skills/skills/stf/SKILL.md  $DEST/skills/stf/

# Lisa (NOT shipped in npm — only available from this repo)
# Skip this block if you don't want the Lisa workflow.
mkdir -p $DEST/commands \
         $DEST/skills/lisa-test \
         $DEST/skills/ai-qa-agent \
         $DEST/skills/guided-exploration \
         $DEST/skills/flutter-test-generator \
         $DEST/skills/lisa-qa-agent
cp docs/claude-skills/agents/lisa-baseline-manager.md         $DEST/agents/
cp docs/claude-skills/agents/lisa-runner.md                   $DEST/agents/
cp docs/claude-skills/agents/lisa-scaffolder.md               $DEST/agents/
cp docs/claude-skills/commands/lisa.md                        $DEST/commands/
cp docs/claude-skills/commands/test-ux.md                     $DEST/commands/
cp docs/claude-skills/skills/lisa-test/SKILL.md               $DEST/skills/lisa-test/
cp docs/claude-skills/skills/ai-qa-agent/SKILL.md             $DEST/skills/ai-qa-agent/
cp docs/claude-skills/skills/guided-exploration/SKILL.md      $DEST/skills/guided-exploration/
cp docs/claude-skills/skills/flutter-test-generator/SKILL.md  $DEST/skills/flutter-test-generator/
cp docs/claude-skills/skills/lisa-qa-agent/SKILL.md           $DEST/skills/lisa-qa-agent/
```

The `stf` skill drives the `fab` CLI / `fab-mcp` server (added in v0.4.0). When you
have `fab-mcp` installed in `~/.claude/.mcp.json`, agents prefer the native MCP tools
(`stf_*`); without it they fall back to `fab` shell commands. Both work, MCP is faster.

### Option B — npm-package consumers (STF only, no Lisa)

After `npm install synthetic-test-fabric`, copy the bundled STF files:

```bash
DEST=~/.claude
mkdir -p $DEST/agents $DEST/skills/stf
cp node_modules/synthetic-test-fabric/docs/claude-skills/agents/stf-runner.md $DEST/agents/
cp node_modules/synthetic-test-fabric/docs/claude-skills/skills/stf/SKILL.md  $DEST/skills/stf/
```

### Option C — Copy to project `.claude/` (this project only)

```bash
# STF only (works against an installed package or this repo)
mkdir -p .claude/agents .claude/skills/stf
cp docs/claude-skills/agents/stf-runner.md .claude/agents/
cp docs/claude-skills/skills/stf/SKILL.md  .claude/skills/stf/
```

---

## MCP servers

For the STF skill, install `fab-mcp` (added in #27) — see `docs/mcp-install.md`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fab": { "command": "fab-mcp" }
  }
}
```

Verify with `npx fab-mcp` or by asking the agent to run `stf_status`.

For Lisa MCP wiring, see the lisa MCP project documentation.

## Keeping in sync

The Lisa-specific skills (everything not under `skills/stf/` or
`agents/stf-runner.md`) live in this repo as reference documentation but do
not ship in the published `synthetic-test-fabric` npm package. Adapt them to
your product before installing into `~/.claude/`.

The STF skill (`skills/stf/SKILL.md`) and agent (`agents/stf-runner.md`)
ship with the package and are product-neutral by design.
